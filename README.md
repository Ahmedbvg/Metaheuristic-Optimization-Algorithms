# üõ†Ô∏è Metaheuristic Optimization Algorithms for University Repair Planning

This project applies popular metaheuristic algorithms ‚Äî **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**, **Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)**, and **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** ‚Äî to simulate and solve optimization problems related to university infrastructure repair and scheduling, such as **dormitory maintenance**, **classroom renovation**, and **facility planning**.

## üéØ Objective

To find the most efficient and cost-effective way to schedule repairs and resource allocation across university buildings using nature-inspired algorithms.

---

## üöÄ Algorithms Implemented

- **ACO (Ant Colony Optimization)**  
  Models cooperative foraging behavior in ants to find the optimal path through a graph of repair tasks.

- **ABC (Artificial Bee Colony)**  
  Simulates intelligent foraging of honeybee swarms for optimal scheduling solutions.

- **PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization)**  
  Uses swarm intelligence inspired by bird flocking to optimize task assignment and timelines.
